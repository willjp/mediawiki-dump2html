TODO
====

* `general`
  now that we have a direction, write tests!

* `renderers.HTML`
  index headers on each page to JSON obj, and write simple javascript search page.

* `renderers.HTML`
  use templating to re-add sidebar?

* `renderers.RST`
  rendered rst has directive `.. _first_title`
  I'm guessing this should be replaced with the actual page title.

* `writers.Dump()`
   simplify error-handling using mv-on-write, this is more complicated than it needs to be.

* `writers.DumpAll()`
   page rendering could easily be asynchronous
